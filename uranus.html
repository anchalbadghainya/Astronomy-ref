            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest 
                diameter in our solar system. It was the first planet found with the aid 
                of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer 
                 Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. <br>It’s not 
                 visible to the naked eye, and became the first planet discovered with the use of a telescope. 
                 Uranus is tipped over on its 
                 side with an axial tilt of 98 degrees. It is often described as “rolling around the Sun on its side.”</p>

            <h4 class="info-title">Description</h4>
            <p>The planet rotates in a retrograde direction, opposite to the 
                way Earth and most other planets turn.During some parts of its orbit one or the other of its poles 
                point directly at the Sun and get about 42 years of direct sunlight. The rest of the time they are 
                in darkness. <br>Like the other gas giants, it has a hydrogen upper layer, which has helium mixed in.
                 Below that is an icy “mantle, which surrounds a rock and ice core. The upper atmosphere is made of water, 
                ammonia and the methane ice crystals that give the planet its pale blue colour. <br>The ring particles
                 are small, ranging from a dust-sized particles to small boulders. There are eleven inner rings and two 
                 outer rings. They probably formed when one or more of Uranus’s moons were broken up in an impact. The 
                 first rings were discovered in 1977 with the two outer 
                rings being discovered in Hubble Space Telescope images between 2003 and 2005.</p>
